# CleaningDataAssignment
======================

This is the Cleaning Data Assignment.

The source data was taken from https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip (1)

The data is in the UCI HAR Dataset folder.

For the assignment I create the file run_analysis.R

The file augustoPoint5df.txt is the tidy data answer for the point 5 of the assignment.

In the codeBook.md file, you will find the information about the transformation process of the data.
